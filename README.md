Welcome to **ZenithPHP**, a simple and lightweight PHP framework designed to streamline web application development.
ZenithPHP follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture and provides developers with a clean and flexible
foundation to build modern PHP applications with ease.

## Features

- **MVC Architecture**: Keeps code organized by separating the business logic, presentation, and data layers.
- **Custom Routing**: Define clean and flexible routes for your application with ease.
- **Simple Namespacing**: Eliminate the need for `require_once` with proper namespacing.
- **Security Built-in**: Features like password hashing and input validation to keep your app secure.
- **Easy to Extend**: Customize the framework to suit your application’s needs with minimal effort.
- **Bootstrap-Ready**: Pre-included Bootstrap for quick UI prototyping.

## Folder Structure

- **App/**: Contains the core application files.
- **Core/**: The framework's core classes and functions.
- **Controller/**: Houses all controllers for handling requests.
- **Model/**: Where the application models are defined.
- **View/**: Contains all view files (HTML/PHP templates).
- **Public/**: The main entry point for the application and assets (JS, CSS, images).
- **routes.php**: Defines all your application's routes.

## How to Get Started

To create your first route:

1. Open `App/routes.php` and define your route:
    ```php
    use ZenithPHP\Core\Http\Router;
    Router::get('/hello', 'WelcomeController', 'index');
    ```

2. Create a new controller (*WelcomeController.php*) inside `App/Controllers/`:
    ```php
    use ZenithPHP\Core\Controller\Controller;

   class WelcomeController extends Controller
   {
      public function index()
      {
         $this->view('welcome');
      }
   }
    ```

3. Now, create a new view file inside `View/welcome.php`:
    ```html
    <h1>Welcome to ZenithPHP</h1>
    ```

4. Visit `http://localhost:8000/welcome` to see the result.
